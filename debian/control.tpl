Description: OrientDB Server
 OrientDB is an Open Source NoSQL DBMS with both the features
 of Document and Graph DBMSs.
 It's written in Java and it's amazing fast: can store up to
 150,000 records per second on common hardware.
 Even if it's Document based database the relationships
 are managed as in Graph Databases with direct connections
 among records. You can traverse entire or part of trees
 and graphs of records in few milliseconds. Supports
 schema-less, schema-full and schema-mixed modes.
 Has a strong security profiling system based on user
 and roles and support the SQL between the query languages.
 Thank to the SQL layer it's straightforward to use it
 for people skilled in Relational world.
